Wifern
	A GUI representation of the wifite program. Same as fern-wifi-cracker but I've added some 
	options for tools that I think wood make a pentesterâ€™s life easier.

Wifite and Fern-wifi-cracker are great programs and the respective developers have done great work with them.
I have used some parts of ether programs for now until I can get around to writing my own methods.

Comming from Visual Studio programming enviroment and new to python I am doing this as a learning exercise
and also in the hopes that the end program could help people.
