  <h1>Wifern</h1>
  
  <h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Graphical User Interface for pentesting purposes. It contains options for a one click use for tools proven to make a pentesterâ€™s life easier.</p>
<p>Similar programs, Wifite and Fern-wifi-cracker, are great programs and the respective developers have done great work with them.
Coming from Visual Studio programming environment and new to python I am doing this as a learning exercise
and also in the hopes that the end program could help people.</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng suite of tools is a must. It is available on many pentesting distributions like Kali Linux and BackBox.</p>
