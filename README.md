  <h1>Wifern</h1>
  
  <h2>Description</h2>
<p>A Graphical User Interface for pentesting purposes. It contains options for a one click use for tools that I think would make a pentesterâ€™s life easier.</p>
<p>Wifite and Fern-wifi-cracker are great programs and the respective developers have done great work with them.
I have used some parts of ether programs for now until I can get around to writing my own methods.

Comming from Visual Studio programming enviroment and new to python I am doing this as a learning exercise
and also in the hopes that the end program could help people.</p>
